<p>In this exercise, I generated a sales receipt for a transaction involving five distinct products. The goal was to demonstrate the usage of expressions and variables for dynamically calculating various necessary values. Through this exercise, I gained hands-on experience in manipulating variable values and the sales receipt to accurately compute the desired results. To access additional information about the exercise, please follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">link</a>. As you can probably tell, I’m really enjoying this class, but here’s the authentic link to <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">RTFM</a>.</p>

<p>My experience while working on the WOD was generally smooth. I maintained good organization in terms of spacing, and much of the process involved repetitive tasks for each respective item. However, a challenge emerged towards the end when I noticed that my sub-total, tax, and total values were not displaying correctly. I “meticulously” reviewed each line of code, checking for syntax errors and missing semicolons. Despite my efforts, I couldn’t identify the root of the problem, and it became quite frustrating. At one point, I even considered adding spaces between the “*” in “price1 * quantity1” to see if it would make a difference. It made me wonder if I had mistyped a variable name. That’s when I discovered I had written “extended_prices1” instead of “extended_price1.” After correcting this, I refreshed the page, and my sub-total displayed correctly. As I continued to investigate, I realized that I had also overlooked calculating the salesTax. I had mistakenly set it to equal the subtotal multiplied by salesTax when it should have been multiplied by the taxRate instead. After resolving this, everything displayed as I wanted it to.</p>

<p>I approached my preparation for this WOD in a manner similar to my previous ones, diligently going through each step, practicing before recording, and taking notes on my iPad to aid with calculations. However, I decided to take a different approach this time. Instead of relying on my notes during the recording, I chose to go with the flow and test my ability to work through the WOD without referencing them. My goal was to motivate myself and potentially increase my speed in completing the exercise. In retrospect, this approach proved to be quite humbling. It had me questioning my life choices.</p>

<p>To improve my level of preparedness, I believe it’s essential for me to avoid procrastinating until the last minute. One of my less-than-ideal habits is mistakenly thinking I’m most productive under immense pressure. This was evident when I consistently worked on WODs and labs until late on Monday night, and into the early hours of Tuesday morning at 4 AM. To genuinely enhance my readiness, I need to allocate more ample time for preparation. I found myself running out of time and becoming increasingly frustrated, particularly due to avoidable errors caused by haste and fatigue. Moving forward, my plan for the next WOD is to start working on it earlier rather than later.</p>
