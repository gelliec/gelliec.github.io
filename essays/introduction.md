*The roof aint my son, but I will raise it.*

I'm Gellie, and my name, pronounced like "jelly" but with a distinct spelling, is indeed my real name. Hailing from Honolulu, Hawaii, I proudly graduated from Moanalua High School in 2016. Since 2017, I've been serving in the Navy as a Second Class Petty Officer specializing in Information Systems Technician, holding qualifications in Information Warfare.

I derive immense pleasure from water-propagating plants, with a special fondness for pothos. Alongside that, my passion for oil painting runs deep. While I occasionally take on commissions, it's a rarity these days due to my commitment to academic pursuits. Among my artwork, a personal favorite is a depiction of John Travolta and Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction. As an avid admirer of Quentin Tarantino's films, I can confidently declare that my cinematic go-to is undoubtedly Kill-Bill Volume 2.
