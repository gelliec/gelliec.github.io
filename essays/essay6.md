## Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

Our team designed an e-commerce store that sells nail sets, 3 unique collections, each with 6 different nail set designs.

## Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

- The shopping cart reverts back to zero after products quantity input have been "added to cart" therefore will not display the cumulative amount of products selected.

## Describe what you are most proud of about your system:

I am proud I got a functioning rating system.

## Describe what you are least happy with your system:

I am least happy how my rating system looks, I would've liked for the stars to populate underneath the products but due to time constraints, I did not change the number rating to a star rating. However, when users input their ratings, its a star. While it is functional, it just isn't consistent aesthetically.

## How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?

I worked in a team instead of doing it by myself.

## When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

I RTFM (ChatGPT) then asked Dan for help.

## Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?

Communication between my group mates.

## Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?

IR1 caused issues as far as we had to maintain the last product page visited by user. When user leaves and comes back to site, they are taken automatically to the last product page visited. After login or register, they return to the last page visited. After checkout, the last page visited becomes the home page. For some reason it did not function the way we want it to.

## What did you learn from doing this assignment?

Collaborating is difficult; my team and I were phenomenal at working together but writing the code where we aren't stepping on each other's toes proved challenging.

## If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

Possibly work on this sooner to get the major requirements down.

## Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

a) 50%
b) 25%
c) 25%

## Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)

Wendy - 42.5% Handled the basic framework of a well-designed user interface,especially since it is her website that was the most functioning e-commerce, sending email,  She handled her own IR3, and assisted me with sessions
Scott - 42.5% Handled the framework of admin back-end, his own IR1, fixed bugs
Gellie - 15% Handled my own IR5, fixed minimal bugs, assisted in creating user's sessions
