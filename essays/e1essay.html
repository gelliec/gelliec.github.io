<p>For my initial exercise, I was assigned the responsibility of designing a basic web page centered on the history of web browsers. This entailed incorporating a title, a table of contents, and five main sections. These sections encompassed an introduction, along with a concise history of Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. On the technical front, I was instructed to incorporate an external link providing a brief overview for each segment. Additionally, to enhance navigation, each entry in the table of contents was linked to its corresponding paragraph. The final requirement was to embed the logo of each browser within its respective section.</p>

<p>Before the recording process, I often found myself retracing steps to reinforce my learning, losing count of the repetitions. I recorded twice, driven by confidence and the need for perfection. My initial attempt stretched longer than expected due to my struggle in articulating a specific procedure; while the concept was clear in my mind, conveying it posed a challenge. Fortunately, my second attempt was more concise, taking only 14 minutes. I chose to rely on instinct, presenting ideas straightforwardly to avoid over-complicating and potentially confusing both myself and the audience.</p>

<p>For those hesitant about recording, particularly if camera shyness is a concern, I recommend practicing without the recording feature. This hesitation, I believe, contributed to my initial faltering, causing me to feel observed and thereby affecting my composure. Having my iPad nearby was invaluable. I was able to jot down errors, like forgetting to annotate the ID tag for headers. This ensures that links in the table of contents lead directly to the intended paragraph.</p>

<p>Additionally, I’d advise users to navigate to the command palette via the gear icon located at the bottom left, then selecting “toggle word wrap”. This facilitates readability. Properly spacing commands and paragraphs not only aesthetically pleases but also makes section identification more efficient.</p>

<h2 id="browserhistory2">BrowserHistory2</h2>

<p>For my subsequent WOD, I was instructed to expand on my initial web page by integrating a CSS file and linking it to my HTML document. Through this CSS file, I had the flexibility to modify elements such as fonts, colors, margins, text sizes, background hues, and the positioning of logos. The CSS essentially served as a tool, allowing me to dictate the visual appeal of my webpage.</p>

<p>Personally, I found this task less challenging, primarily because I had previously researched CSS commands, particularly those related to font customization. However, a hurdle I encountered was the initial oversight of correctly linking and referencing the CSS and font files in the HTML document. This oversight led to some of the changes I made in the CSS not reflecting on the live webpage. Thankfully, I was able to complete my recording successfully within 7 minutes on my maiden attempt. I attribute part of this success to the valuable insights from W3Schools, which proved instrumental in guiding me through the intricacies of font adjustments and other CSS commands. I’d highly recommend leveraging resources like W3Schools for a better understanding.</p>

<h2 id="browserhistory3">BrowserHistory3</h2>

<p>For my concluding WOD, I was tasked with further enhancing the aesthetics of my webpage. This involved restructuring the layout to present three columns side-by-side, each dedicated to the brief histories of Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. Additionally, the original table of contents underwent a transformation, metamorphosing into a sleek navigation bar.</p>

<p>I successfully executed this task in my initial attempt, completing it in just under 10 minutes (with a precise 30 seconds to spare). My ease with this assignment can be attributed to the indispensable guidance from W3Schools. Furthermore, my prior experience tinkering with the CSS for platforms like Tumblr, which allowed for HTML customization, greatly assisted me. Many features in CSS reminded me of the style tags in HTML used on Tumblr, which provided users the liberty to modify fonts and other aesthetic aspects.</p>

<p>My advice to others would be to immerse oneself in the coding process. Before I embarked on the recording, I experimented with various parameters, such as pixel values, to observe their impact. I also explored the capabilities of the navigation bar, even integrating a feature that affixed it to the browser’s top using the “sticky” command. Delving into code, testing its boundaries, and enjoying the process is, in my view, the best approach.</p>
