## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

I have developed a strong proficiency in both CSS and HTML. During the creation of my index page for Assignment 1, despite utilizing a template from W3's Bootstrap, I invested several hours fine-tuning the placement and styling of images and text to meet my aesthetic goals. This process deepened my understanding of how HTML content, framed within tags such as divs, h1, h2, and headers, can be dynamically manipulated through CSS. Earlier labs introduced this concept, but hands-on practice revealed the intriguing effects of applying CSS directives to these elements. While inline styling in HTML can be convenient for quick changes, it can also clutter the markup when the associated CSS is extensive. Furthermore, my coding skills were notably enhanced by mastering "for" loops, as demonstrated in our product display HTML. This approach enabled a more efficient listing of products, bypassing the need for manual enumeration. Additionally, I gained insight into how HTML not only intertwines with CSS but also how JSON can be leveraged in lieu of JavaScript, streamlining the process of loading product information.

## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

Improving my grasp of functions and boolean logic remains a priority for me. While I grasp the concepts during guided sessions, I find that applying them independently proves challenging. I've had the opportunity to work closely with Dan Port, who has been instrumental in helping me understand how to display my products and manage server-side code. However, there's still room for growth in my comprehension of parameters and conditional statements. My goal is to achieve a level of proficiency where I can navigate these areas without the need for repeated guidance. Dan comes highly recommended as a mentor; his patience and ability to teach without assuming prior expertise are particularly supportive. His tutelage has been invaluable, especially since it provides a space where I can comfortably ask questions that I'm hesitant to raise in a group setting. This personalized learning experience has not only bolstered my coding skills but also reinforced a calm and methodical approach to problem-solving, which I believe will be a great asset in my future career.

## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

I acknowledge the significant learning I've achieved through completing the Workouts of the Day (WODs). My confidence has grown to the point where I can now tackle the initial WODs independently, without the need to refer to the screencasts. The more recent WODs, particularly those concerning invoice creation, posed a greater challenge. They required me to delve deeply into the documentation and seek assistance from resources like ChatGPT to fully comprehend the instructions provided in the manual.

## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

The initial labs were quite accessible, offering clear, step-by-step guidance that facilitated my understanding. However, as the curriculum progressed, the instructions became less explicit, intentionally pushing us to apply our knowledge and problem-solving skills independently. While this approach has its merits, I believe there's still value in providing detailed, step-by-step instructions coupled with examples of expected outcomes. This structure would enable me to break down and assimilate the processes more effectively. Being able to trace through a detailed walkthrough helps solidify my comprehension, allowing me to learn by doing before venturing into more autonomous problem-solving.

## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

Working on Assignment 1 has been a profoundly educational experience for me, thanks to the combined support of ChatGPT, the invaluable assistance of Dan Port, and the collaborative efforts with several classmates. Their insights have been crucial in helping me grasp the requirements, comprehend the actions I've taken, and identify areas for enhancement on my web pages. I'm poised to take on Assignment 2, buoyed by the confidence gained from surmounting the substantial challenge of constructing my webpage in Assignment 1. I anticipate that Assignment 2, with its focus on enhancing my website with new features, will be an exciting learning opportunity and a chance to demonstrate my growing proficiency as we progress.

## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

To enhance my learning experience, I suggest the possibility of conducting a Zoom session during class, which would allow me to record the proceedings. Dan's verbal walkthroughs while coding are incredibly helpful, yet I struggle to concentrate on his explanations and simultaneously transcribe the code into my VSCode. Although I recognize the importance of comprehending code before typing it out, having access to a recording of Dan's step-by-step lab demonstrations—mirroring a one-on-one session—would be highly advantageous for my learning style.

## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):

Personalized assistance is what I find most beneficial during class. My sessions with Dan have significantly deepened my comprehension, as they provide a comfortable environment to inquire about aspects I'm uncertain of without the worry of holding up the rest of the class. Dan’s interactive method of teaching, where he prompts me to explain the reasons behind certain outcomes, ensures that I am fully engaged and assimilating the material. His approach is not only instructive but also affirming. Collaborating with my peers is another valuable aspect of my learning journey; they often remind me of details that Dan may have covered in class, which I might have overlooked. This peer support is instrumental in reinforcing our collective learning in the coursework.
