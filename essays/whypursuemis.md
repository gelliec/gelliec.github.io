In 2017, I joined the Navy as an Information Systems Technician, commonly referred to as an IT. During my service, I've been assigned to both Naval Computer Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic and Pacific. I have also served on two destroyers, the USS Daniel Inouye and the USS Hopper. 

My responsibilities have encompassed maintaining network and radio connectivity for both shipboard and shore activities. While this might sound impressive, my main role often involves ensuring that essentials like Facebook access and email services run smoothly for everyone on board.

Merely a year ago, I had the distinct honor of being chosen for a commissioning program tailored to enlisted sailors, providing an opportunity to attain a bachelor's degree and transition into a naval officer. The program offered comprehensive financial support and a unique three-year period to experience 'civilian life' before returning to the fleet. Among a competitive pool of 435 enlisted Sailors, I was privileged to secure the role of an Information Professional (IP) through a rigorous selection process. This designation resonates deeply with my expertise and experience gained during my service in the Navy.

## Debugging Life: When Majoring in Computer Science Didn't Compile as Expected

From the allure of Hollywood hackers uttering the iconic phrase 'I'm in' to the days of jazzing up my MySpace profile with HTML tricks and a bold Hello Kitty backdrop, my fascination with coding seemed destined. Eager to fulfill the technical degree requirement mandated by the Navy for my upcoming role, computer science felt like the perfect fit. 

Yet, the dramatic allure of coding quickly faded, starting with my miserable experience in an introductory 200-level ICS course during the early days of fall semester. In a mere three days, I shifted gears and changed my major. As the credits rolled on my brief coding stint, I found solace in embracing a business degree and waving a fond farewell to coding... I guess you could say I couldn't 'esc.'

## Cache These Hands!

Although coding isn't precisely what I envisaged within the realm of MIS, my initial selection of this major was based on its amalgamation of technology and business â€“ a convergence that resonated with me. Opting for this major was a strategic choice, one that offered financial stability and the potential for personal and fleet benefits in the future.

I considered MIS to be a formidable challenge that, upon conquering, would yield a highly satisfying sense of achievement. Presently immersed in coding, I've experienced the initial hurdles of installing numerous applications, yet I am gradually gaining a more confident grasp of the intricacies involved.
