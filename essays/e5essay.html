  <h2 id="assignment-2-scope">Assignment 2 Scope</h2>

<p>Assignment 2 is an enhancement of Assignment 1, aimed at improving the existing website by adding a personalized user experience. This involves creating a user registration and login system, enabling a more tailored interaction for each user. After logging in, users will receive personalized invoices and have the ability to make purchases. Key to this assignment is the incorporation of robust security measures, including encrypted password storage, password strength enforcement, tracking of user logins, and displaying the number of active users. An important aspect of this assignment is understanding the value of these technologies without relying on sessions or cookies, a concept that will be explored more in future assignments. This approach aims to strengthen foundational knowledge in building secure and user-friendly e-commerce platforms.

<h2 id="what-i-learned-in-assignment-2">What I learned in Assignment 2</h2>

<p>This project represented an intensive exploration into web application development, with a specific focus on user data management and security. It provided me with valuable insights into securely managing user registration and login processes, emphasizing the importance of data persistence and robust security measures. One of the more challenging yet enlightening aspects was managing user sessions without the use of traditional cookies or session management tools, offering a unique learning experience in this area of web development.</p>

<h2 id="partnership--contribution">Partnership &amp; Contribution</h2>

<p>I did not work with a partner, it was 100% my work.</p>

<h2 id="seeking-assistance">Seeking Assistance</h2>

<p>Guidance from Dan Port was instrumental in my project, particularly his advice on handling invalid user inputs. He suggested displaying error messages directly below the relevant input fields, such as the email or full name, to clearly inform users of the specific requirements. This approach helped me recognize the importance of understanding and adapting the code beyond simply replicating what is provided by sources like ChatGPT. It emphasized the need to discern which parts of the code are applicable and how to strategically place them for optimal functionality.</p>

<h2 id="assignment-2-vs-assignment-1">Assignment 2 vs. Assignment 1</h2>

<p>Assignment 2 marked a significant shift from the foundational elements addressed in Assignment 1, necessitating a more sophisticated understanding of critical web application functionalities. This advanced phase involved a comprehensive focus on user authentication processes, efficient data storage solutions, and the development of individualized user experiences. Diverging from the rudimentary web design principles of the initial assignment, this stage accentuated the importance of robust security protocols and intricate data handling, thereby elevating the technical and complexity standards of the project.</p>

<h2 id="estimate-the--of-time-you-spent-a-thinking-about-how-to-do-something-b-writing-code-but-do-not-include-testing-c-testing-and-debugging">Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h2>

<p>a) Thinking about how to do something: 40%
b) Writing code: 30%
c) Testing and debugging: 30%</p>

<h2 id="describe-what-worked-well-with-this-project-what-did-not-work-well">Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h2>

<p>The construction of my login page was a successful aspect of the project, but I encountered challenges with validating user input and effectively displaying error messages.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-go-back-in-time-and-do-things-differently-what-would-you-do-differently">If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h2>

<p>Reflecting on the project, if given the opportunity to revisit it, I would begin working on it earlier and approach the requirements with a more logical mindset, rather than overthinking them. This approach likely would have saved considerable time. Additionally, I would have put more effort into completing the remaining Individual Requirements (IRs) for extra credit, with the hope of achieving a satisfactory grade.</p>
